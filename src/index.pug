              | The DOME Project (Drone Operations for Mars Exploration) is a
              | research group, built between universities and companies which
              | aims at developing new remote and autonomous operated aerial
              | platforms for the Exploration of the Mars surface.<br/>
              | Aerial drone platforms are a cutting-edge technology asset in a
              | huge range of human operations such as medical, firefighting and
              | military scenarios. In extraplanetary exploration, aerial drone
              | platforms can cover the operational conditions that meet both the
              | high precision capabilities of surface rovers and the extensive
              | areas coverage capabilities typical of orbital operations.
            p
              | In almost 60 years of human exploration of Mars, we tested a wide
              | range of technologies on its surface, using platforms as Rovers,
              | probes and orbiters. Mars is the planets with the biggest robot
              | population in the solar system.<br/>
              | Right now the most realistic strategy for a sustainble human
              | presence on Mars is through the ISRU (In Situ Resources Utilization),
              | which use can significantly reduce the need of continous resupply
              | missions from earth.<br/>
              | Until we explored less then the 1% of the Mars surface. We need
              | new platforms to rapidly increase our exploration capabilities if we
              | want to seriously boost the first human missions.

              | Aerial Drone technology has evolved faster and faster during the
              | last years thanks to its recognised value for the automation of
              | human activities. Hardware miniaturization and high efficiency
              | of machine learning protocols, brought this technology
              | to a fundamental role in high-risks scenarios.<br/>
              | Mars, thanks to its similarity with the Earth in terms of planetary
              | environmental condition, represents a total new ground to expand
              | the boundaries of this technology.<br/>
              | Aerial drones can become a fundamental subsystem of every
              | human activity on Mars: logistics, safety inspections, surface
              | mapping and multispectral analysis can be safely left to
              | swarms of autonomous flying drones.
            p The DOME project research background is focused on:
            ul
              li Deep learning algorithm
              li Solar power management

            p
              | The X-5 Drone is an experimental concept for an autonomous
              |  aerial platform designed to complement the firsts human crews on
              | the martian surface. The X-5 is powered by lightweights flexible
              | double-junction solar panels, that assure a dawn-sunset flight
              | autonomy. Thanks to its VTOL capabilities, the Drone can autonomously
              | take off and reach the mission objectives without the need
              | for a direct control from the crew.
            p
              | The X-5 Payload is composed by 2 cameras (one fixed global-shutter
              | camera and one for navigation) and a huge range of
              | sensors. The camera can be switched for more mission-specific
              | payloads such as multispectral sensors or thermal vision devices.
            p The operational scenarios covered by the X-5 are:
            ul
              li Photogrammetry mapping
              li Surface composition analysis
              li Search &amp; rescue missions
            p
              | The X-5 Drone will be tested by the crew 212 during the LATAM III
              | mission at the MDRS.
