              | The DOME Project (Drone Operations for Martian Environment) is a
              | research group, built between universities and companies which
              | aims at developing new remote and autonomous operated aerial
              | platforms for the Environment of the Mars surface.<br/>
              | Aerial drone platforms are a cutting-edge technology asset in a
              | huge range of human operations such as medical, firefighting and
              | military scenarios. In extraplanetary exploration, aerial drone
              | platforms can cover the operational conditions that meet both the
              | high precision capabilities of surface rovers and the extensive
              | areas coverage capabilities typical of orbital operations.
            p
              | In almost 60 years of human exploration of Mars, we tested a wide
              | range of technologies on its surface, using platforms as Rovers,
              | probes and orbiters. Mars is the planets with the biggest robot
              | population in the solar system.<br/>
              | Right now the most realistic strategy for a sustainble human
              | presence on Mars is through the ISRU (In Situ Resources Utilization),
              | which use can significantly reduce the need of continous resupply
              | missions from earth.<br/>
              | Until we explored less then the 1% of the Mars surface. We need
              | new platforms to rapidly increase our exploration capabilities if we
              | want to seriously boost the first human missions.

              | Aerial Drone technology has evolved faster and faster during the
              | last years thanks to its recognised value for the automation of
              | human activities. Hardware miniaturization and high efficiency
              | of machine learning protocols, brought this technology
              | to a fundamental role in high-risks scenarios.<br/>
              | Mars, thanks to its similarity with the Earth in terms of planetary
              | environmental condition, represents a total new ground to expand
              | the boundaries of this technology.<br/>
              | Aerial drones can become a fundamental subsystem of every
              | human activity on Mars: logistics, safety inspections, surface
              | mapping and multispectral analysis can be safely left to
              | swarms of autonomous flying drones.

                    p
                      | The X-5 Drone is an experimental concept for an autonomous
                      |  aerial platform designed to complement the firsts human crews on
                      | the martian surface. The X-5 is powered by lightweights flexible
                      | double-junction solar panels, that assure a dawn-sunset flight
                      | autonomy. Thanks to its VTOL capabilities, the Drone can autonomously
                      | take off and reach the mission objectives without the need
                      | for a direct control from the crew.
                    p
                      | The X-5 Payload is composed by 2 cameras (one fixed global-shutter
                      | camera and one for navigation) and a huge range of
                      | sensors. The camera can be switched for more mission-specific
                      | payloads such as multispectral sensors or thermal vision devices.
                    p The operational scenarios covered by the X-5 are:
                    ul
                      li Photogrammetry mapping
                      li Surface composition analysis
                      li Search &amp; rescue missions
                    p
                      | The X-5 Drone will be tested by the crew 212 during the LATAM III
                      | mission at the MDRS.

                      | The project consists on testing possible mission scenarios
                      | for an unmanned aerial vehicle in the proximity of the MDRS,
                      | to evaluate its utility and the amount of crew involvement
                      | that would be required. A quadcopter will be used to
                      | perform multiple missions during EVAs, and the possibility
                      | of commanding the vehicle from inside the station will be
                      | evaluated. Focus will be given to navigation technologies,
                      | with the possibility of testing a system of beacons distributed
                      | around the station to allow the triangulation of the signal;
                      | this is due to the current absence of a global positioning
                      | system on Mars.
                    p
                      | Two different types of scenarios will be evaluated: exploration
                      | and monitoring. In the first case, the drone is flying
                      | autonomously and itâ€™s used by the crew from the inside of
                      | the station to take pictures of the surroundings. This
                      | enables the crew to acquire a general understanding of
                      | the environment around the station, and can also be used
                      | as a weathercasting system for sandstorms. For monitoring
                      | missions, the drone looks back at the station and navigates
                      | autonomously to specific points of interest on the MDRS
                      | facilities and allows their observation by the crew.
